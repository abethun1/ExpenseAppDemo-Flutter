# expense_app

This is my second app build for my month of making Flutter applications. It is a base build of
a finance tracking app that I developed while learning flutter through an online development class
with Academind. The main reason for developing this app was to learn more about widgets and how the
build system in flutter works, and to use my own programming knowledge to build upon the basics taught in class
and make a fully functional application within a month that is unique and would demonstrate my ongoing profiencey
with flutter and development as a whole.
